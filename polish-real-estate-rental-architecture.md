# Smart Contract Architecture for Polish Real Estate Rental Management System

## 1. Overall Architecture

The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns, focusing on payment processing and contract verification on-chain while keeping most operational data off-chain.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "On-Chain Components"
        RC[RentalCore] --> |manages| P[Properties]
        RC --> |manages| A[Agreements]
        RC --> |manages| PM[PaymentManager]
        RC --> |uses| ACM[AccessControlManager]
        RC --> |uses| CV[ComplianceVerifier]
        CV --> |connects to| O[Oracles]
        PM --> |handles| D[Deposits]
        PM --> |processes| RP[RentalPayments]
    end
    
    subgraph "Off-Chain Components"

        API --> |reads/writes| DB[(Database)]
        API --> |calls| RC
        O --> |fetches data from| EDS[External Data Sources]
        DB --> |stores| DOC[Documents]
        DB --> |stores| UD[User Data]
        DB --> |stores| PD[Property Details]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Layer"
        IL[Integration Services] --> |connects| PS[Payment Systems]
        IL --> |connects| LV[Legal Verification]
        IL --> |connects| NS[Notification Services]
        IL --> API
    end
```

## 2. Core Smart Contracts

### 2.1 RentalCore Contract

This is the main entry point for the system, orchestrating interactions between other contracts.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class RentalCore {
        +address owner
        +mapping(uint256 => Property) properties
        +mapping(uint256 => Agreement) agreements
        +registerProperty(propertyDetails)
        +createAgreement(propertyId, tenantAddress, terms)
        +terminateAgreement(agreementId)
        +updateAgreementStatus(agreementId, status)
        +getPropertyDetails(propertyId)
        +getAgreementDetails(agreementId)
    }
```

### 2.2 Property Contract

Represents real estate properties in the system.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Property {
        +uint256 propertyId
        +address owner
        +bytes32 propertyDataHash
        +bool isActive
        +uint256[] agreementHistory
        +transferOwnership(newOwner)
        +updatePropertyData(newDataHash)
        +setActiveStatus(status)
    }
```

### 2.3 Agreement Contract

Manages rental agreements between landlords and tenants.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Agreement {
        +uint256 agreementId
        +uint256 propertyId
        +address landlord
        +address tenant
        +uint256 startDate
        +uint256 endDate
        +uint256 rentAmount
        +uint256 depositAmount
        +AgreementStatus status
        +bytes32 termsHash
        +bytes32[] amendmentHashes
        +sign(signer)
        +addAmendment(amendmentHash)
        +updateStatus(newStatus)
        +extendAgreement(newEndDate)
    }
```

### 2.4 PaymentManager Contract

Handles all payment-related functionality.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PaymentManager {
        +mapping(uint256 => PaymentHistory) paymentRecords
        +processRentPayment(agreementId, amount)
        +processDeposit(agreementId, amount)
        +releaseDeposit(agreementId, amount, recipient)
        +getPaymentHistory(agreementId)
        +calculateOutstandingRent(agreementId)
        +handleLateFees(agreementId)
    }
```

### 2.5 AccessControlManager Contract

Manages permissions and access control.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AccessControlManager {
        +mapping(address => Role) roles
        +mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => bool)) permissions
        +assignRole(address, role)
        +grantPermission(address, permission)
        +revokePermission(address, permission)
        +hasPermission(address, permission)
    }
```

### 2.6 ComplianceVerifier Contract

Ensures compliance with Polish real estate laws and regulations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ComplianceVerifier {
        +mapping(bytes32 => bool) complianceChecks
        +verifyContractCompliance(agreementId)
        +verifyLandlordCompliance(landlordAddress)
        +verifyTenantCompliance(tenantAddress)
        +updateComplianceParameters(parameters)
        +getComplianceStatus(agreementId)
    }
```

### 2.7 Oracle Integration Contract

Interfaces with external data sources for compliance verification.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OracleIntegration {
        +mapping(bytes32 => address) oracles
        +requestExternalData(dataType, parameters)
        +receiveOracleData(requestId, result)
        +registerOracle(oracleType, oracleAddress)
        +updateOracleAddress(oracleType, newAddress)
    }
```

## 3. Data Model for On-Chain Storage

The on-chain data model will be minimal, focusing only on essential data needed for contract verification and payment processing.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROPERTY {
        uint256 id PK
        address owner
        bytes32 dataHash
        bool isActive
    }
    
    AGREEMENT {
        uint256 id PK
        uint256 propertyId FK
        address landlord
        address tenant
        uint256 startDate
        uint256 endDate
        uint256 rentAmount
        uint256 depositAmount
        enum status
        bytes32 termsHash
    }
    
    PAYMENT {
        uint256 id PK
        uint256 agreementId FK
        uint256 amount
        uint256 timestamp
        enum paymentType
        bool confirmed
    }
    
    COMPLIANCE_CHECK {
        uint256 id PK
        uint256 entityId
        enum entityType
        uint256 timestamp
        bool passed
        bytes32 detailsHash
    }
    
    PROPERTY ||--o{ AGREEMENT : "has"
    AGREEMENT ||--o{ PAYMENT : "receives"
    AGREEMENT ||--o{ COMPLIANCE_CHECK : "undergoes"
    PROPERTY ||--o{ COMPLIANCE_CHECK : "undergoes"
```

## 4. Access Control and Permission System

The system will implement a role-based access control system with the following roles and permissions:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Roles"
        SA[System Admin]
        LL[Landlord]
        TN[Tenant]
        BR[Broker]
        PM[Property Manager]
        LV[Legal Verifier]
    end
    
    subgraph "Permissions"
        P1[Register Property]
        P2[Create Agreement]
        P3[Modify Agreement]
        P4[Process Payment]
        P5[Access Payment History]
        P6[Verify Compliance]
        P7[Transfer Ownership]
        P8[Terminate Agreement]
        P9[Update System Parameters]
    end
    
    SA --> P1
    SA --> P2
    SA --> P3
    SA --> P4
    SA --> P5
    SA --> P6
    SA --> P7
    SA --> P8
    SA --> P9
    
    LL --> P1
    LL --> P2
    LL --> P3
    LL --> P5
    LL --> P7
    LL --> P8
    
    TN --> P4
    TN --> P5
    TN --> P8
    
    BR --> P1
    BR --> P2
    BR --> P5
    
    PM --> P3
    PM --> P4
    PM --> P5
    
    LV --> P6
```

## 5. Upgrade Mechanisms

The architecture will implement the following upgrade mechanisms to allow for future modifications:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Upgrade Mechanisms"
        P[Proxy Pattern] --> |delegates calls to| I[Implementation Contracts]
        G[Governance Contract] --> |controls| P
        G --> |proposes| U[Upgrades]
        G --> |executes| U
        T[Timelock] --> |delays| U
    end
```

1. **Proxy Pattern**: All core contracts will be deployed behind proxies to allow for upgrades without changing contract addresses.
2. **Governance Contract**: A dedicated governance contract will manage the upgrade process.
3. **Timelock Mechanism**: Upgrades will be subject to a timelock period to allow users to review changes.
4. **Emergency Pause**: Critical functions can be paused in case of emergencies.

## 6. Integration with Off-Chain Systems

The architecture will include the following integration points with off-chain systems:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "On-Chain"
        SC[Smart Contracts]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Layer"
        API[API Gateway]
        ES[Event Subscriber]
        DS[Document Service]
        NS[Notification Service]
        PS[Payment Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Off-Chain Systems"
        DB[(Database)]
        DMS[Document Management]
        CRM[Customer Relationship Management]
        ACS[Accounting System]
        LVS[Legal Verification System]
    end
    
    SC --> |emits events| ES
    ES --> |processes| API
    API --> |stores data| DB
    API --> |manages documents| DMS
    API --> |updates customer info| CRM
    API --> |records transactions| ACS
    API --> |verifies compliance| LVS
    
    API --> |calls| SC
    DS --> |stores hashes on| SC
    NS --> |triggered by| SC
    PS --> |processes payments through| SC
```

## 7. Handling Edge Cases

The architecture will address the identified edge cases as follows:

### 7.1 Payment-Related Edge Cases

```mermaid
graph TD
    LP[Late Payments] --> |handled by| LFM[Late Fee Mechanism]

    IDM --> LC
    EHM --> LC
    FMM --> LC
```

## 8. Implementation Considerations

### 8.1 Gas Optimization

1. **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Store only essential data on-chain
2. **Batched Operations**: Implement batching for multiple operations
3. **Gas-Efficient Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures to minimize gas costs
4. **Event-Based Architecture**: Use events for off-chain systems to track changes

### 8.2 Security Measures

1. **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
2. **Access Control**: Strict role-based access control
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency pause functionality
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam attacks
5. **Formal Verification**: Critical contracts should undergo formal verification

### 8.3 Oracle Integration

1. **Chainlink Integration**: For reliable external data
2. **Multiple Oracle Sources**: To prevent single points of failure
3. **Data Validation**: Validate oracle data before use
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: In case of oracle failures
